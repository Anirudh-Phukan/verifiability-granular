other hive products from your nearest local beekeeper\n- Raise awareness among children and adolescents on the importance of bees and express your support for beekeepers\n- Set up a pollinator farm on your balcony, terrace, or garden\n- Preserve old meadows, which feature a more diverse array of flowers, and sow nectar-bearing plants\n- Cut grass on meadows only after the nectar-bearing plants have finished blooming\n- Use pesticides that do not harm bees, and spray them in windless weather, either early in the morning or late at night, when bees withdraw from blossoms", "Your contribution will benefit Friends of the Earth.", "Save the bees is a common plea \u2014 not just from Friends of the Earth.", "You\u2019ve likely seen it plastered on t-shirts, on mugs, and on images online.", "But why are bees so important?", "The simplest answer is that bees pollinate food crops.", "Pollination occurs when insects \u2014 like bees and other pollinators \u2014 travel from one plant to the next, fertilizing the plant.", "Bees have little hairs all over their body that attract pollen.", "When the pollen from a flower sticks to a bee, it then travels with the bee to its next destination.", "When a bee lands on the next plant or flower, the pollen is distributed which results in cross-pollination.", "This process is what later yields fruits, vegetables, and seeds.", "Bees are one of the world\u2019s most important pollinators for food crops \u2014 each day we rely on bees and other pollinators.", "In fact, out of every three bites we consume relies on pollination.", "Yet bee populations continue to decline due to the rampant use of pesticides and other environmental factors \u2014 like climate change.", "We cannot stress how important bees are \u2014 not only to people, but to the overall environment.", "A vast majority of flowering plants rely on pollinators to reproduce.", "As we mentioned above, fruits and vegetables all rely on pollinators transporting pollen from one flower to the next.", "But the value of bees goes beyond just supplying countless fruits and vegetables.", "Bees are also responsible for nuts, coffee, and even spices \u2014 but we can get to that shortly.", "Here are the top 5 reasons why bees are important, they:\n- Help produce 1/3 of our food supply\n- Help provide \u00bd of the world\u2019s fibers, oils, and other raw materials\n- Help create many medicines\n- Provide food for wildlife\n- Help prevent soil erosion\nCould you imagine walking into your grocery store and not seeing the shelves lined with food?", "There would be few fresh fruits or vegetables.", "There would be no products containing honey, almonds, coffee, and chocolate!", "Even milk and beef would be in short supply.", "That\u2019s right \u2014 pollinators like bees are responsible for plants that feed cattle \u2014 like alfalfa.", "Pollinators are responsible for an extensive amount of the foods that we consume.", "Pollinators (including moths, flies, beetles, birds, bats and more) are also part of maintaining the lungs of our planet.", "Pollinators help the growth of many trees as well as other plants!", "They are truly a keystone species \u2013 a vital part of many ecosystems.", "So taking a step back to look at why bees are important to humans, the answer is very clear.", "Bees are a cornerstone of our food system and along with other pollinators, they help support the plants that provide the air we breathe.", "Nearly 90% of flowering plant species on the planet require pollinators to aid in reproduction.", "This not only provides a food system for wildlife, but it also creates shelter for animals.", "There are over 20,000 bee species across the globe with 4,000 of them being native to the U.S. One of the most notable bees is the honey bee.", "The honeybee is responsible for nearly a third of crop pollination.", "But these hardworking insects produce more than that!", "They have six hive products \u2014 pollen, honey, beeswax, royal jelly, propolis, and venom.", "These are all collected and used for nutritional and medical purposes by humans.", "There is no way to overstate the importance of bees.", "The wind does play a role in pollination, so we cannot overlook the fact that we would have some food to eat \u2014 just nothing that would be tasty to eat day in and day out.", "The wind is responsible for the pollination of corn and wheat.", "But the majority of our nutritious foods are bee-assisted.", "No almonds.", "No apples.", "No cherries.", "The list goes on and on.", "Humans would lose a healthy, vibrant diet.", "Then what?", "It\u2019s possible that advancements in technology would find ways to pollinate by \u201chand\u201d \u2014 or by drone \u2014 we really don\u2019t know what the future holds.", "But hand-pollinating is expensive.", "And guess where those costs would be absorbed?", "By consumers!", "IF you could get your hands on fresh fruits and vegetables \u2014 it would cost you an arm and a leg.", "Bee declines warn us that we are on a toxic track.", "The same pesticides that are killing bees threaten many other insects, which are the basis of our ecosystems.", "And these toxic chemicals contaminate the air and water.", "They even linger in soil for months or years, harming the vital soil communities we need to grow our food.", "If we step up to save the bees, it means that we\u2019ll be saving so many other creatures, too.", "But we know that if we keep losing our bees, we\u2019ll be living in a world with troubles greater than paying $50 for an orange."]}

in the UK: insecticides targeting insect pests, fungicides targeting fungal pathogens of crops and herbicides targeting weeds.", "Insecticides contain chemicals that can kill pollinators, so

food sources for pollinators.", "Yet drifting clouds of herbicide from growing fields can contaminate these wildflower strips.", "The most cutting-edge research suggests glyphosate (the most commonly used weed killer) can impact the gut microbes of bees , which can have devastating implications for their health.", "Although exposure to herbicides and pesticides used by farmers is likely to be one

is farmed has been associated with declines in biodiversity and pollination.", "Farming destroys the kinds of spaces that bees use to nest, it takes away the diversity of food that bees use to forage on and it even has wider impacts on other animals like wild birds, mammals and amphibians.", "While countless insect species are currently going extinct, those that remain are taking their place , so it\u2019s unlikely that crops will stop being pollinated any time soon.", "Generalist species such as the buff-tailed bumblebee, the European honey bee and common small black flies, which can survive in a huge range of temperatures and conditions, will become the main species pollinating our food sources, while rarer, more specialist species will decline.", "But as generalist species move in to

mandarinate in AD 605.", "The following Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) adopted the same measures for drafting officials, and decreasingly relied on aristocratic recommendations and more and more on promotion based on the results of written examinations.", "The structure of the examination system was extensively expanded during the reign of Wu Zetian .", "[6] The system reached its apogee during the Song dynasty.", "[7]\nIn theory, the Chinese civil service system provided one of the main avenues for social mobility in Chinese society, although in practice, due to the time-consuming nature of the study, the examination was generally only taken by sons of the landed gentry.", "[8] The examination tested the candidate's memorization of the Nine Classics of Confucianism and his ability to compose poetry using fixed and traditional forms and calligraphy .", "It was ideally suited to literary candidates.", "Thus, toward the end of the Ming Dynasty, the system attracted the candidature of Tang Xianzu (1550-1616).", "Tang at 14 passed the imperial examination at the county level; and at 21, he did so at the provincial level; but not until he was 34 did he pass at the national level.", "However, he had already become a well-known poet at age 12, and among other things he went on to such distinction as a profound literati and dramatist that it would not be far-fetched to regard him as China's answer to William Shakespeare: Wang Rongpei and Zhang Ling (eds), The Complete Works of Tang Xianzu (2018).", "In the late 19th century, however, the system increasingly engendered internal dissatisfaction, and was criticized as not reflecting candidates' ability to govern well, and for giving undue weight to style over content and originality of thought.", "Indeed, long before its abandonment, the notion of the imperial system as a route to social mobility was somewhat mythical.", "In Tang's magnum opus, The Peony Pavilion, sc 13, Leaving Home, the male lead, Liu Mengmei, laments: \"After twenty years of studies, I still have no hope of getting into office\", and on this point Tang may be speaking through Liu as his alter ego.", "The system was finally abolished by the Qing government in 1905 as part of the New Policies reform package.", "The Chinese system was often admired by European commentators from the 16th century onward.", "[9] However, the Chinese imperial examination system was hardly universally admired by all Europeans who knew of it.", "In a debate in the unelected chamber of the UK parliament on March 13, 1854, John Browne 'pointed out [clearly with some disdain ] that the only precedent for appointing civil servants by literary exams was that of the Chinese government': Coolican (2018), ch.5: The Northcote-Trevelyan Report, pp106\u2013107.", "In the 18th century, in response to economic changes and the growth of the British Empire , the bureaucracy of institutions such as the Office of Works and the Navy Board greatly expanded.", "Each had its own system, but in general, staff were appointed through patronage or outright purchase.", "By the 19th century, it became increasingly clear that these arrangements were falling short.", "\"The origins of the British civil service are better known.", "During the eighteenth century a number of Englishmen wrote in praise of the Chinese examination system, some of them going so far as to urge the adoption for England of something similar.", "The first concrete step in this direction was taken by the British East India Company in 1806.\"", "[10] In that year, the Honourable East India Company established a college, the East India Company College , near London to train and examine administrators of the company's territories in India.", "[11] \"The proposal for establishing this college came, significantly, from members of the East India Company's trading post in Canton, China.\"", "[10] Examinations for the Indian \"civil service\"\u2014a term coined by the Company\u2014were introduced in 1829.", "[12]\nBritish efforts at reform were influenced by the imperial examinations system and meritocratic system of China.", "Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou , China argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China , published in 1847, that \"the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only,\" and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.", "[10] On the other hand, John Browne, in the 1854 debate mentioned above, 'argued that elegant writing had become an end in itself, and the stultifying effect of this on the Chinese civil service had contributed in no small measure to China's failure to develop its early lead over Western civilisations': Coolican, p107.", "In 1853 the Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone , commissioned Sir Stafford Northcote and Charles Trevelyan to look into the operation and organisation of the Civil Service.", "Influenced by the Chinese imperial examinations, the Northcote\u2013Trevelyan Report of 1854 made four principal recommendations: that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through competitive examination, that candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, that recruits should be graded into a hierarchy and that promotion should be through achievement, rather than \"preferment, patronage or purchase\".", "It also recommended a clear division between staff responsible for routine (\"mechanical\") work, and those engaged in policy formulation and implementation in an \"administrative\" class.", "[13]\nThe report was well-timed, because bureaucratic chaos during the Crimean War was causing a clamour for the change.", "The report's conclusions were immediately implemented, and a permanent, unified and politically neutral civil service was introduced as Her Majesty's Civil Service .", "A Civil Service Commission was also set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other Northcote\u2013Trevelyan recommendations were implemented over some years.", "[14] Or so one version of the story goes.", "There are, however, more nuanced ways to tell the tale.", "Despite [civil servants'] many similarities, there also exists a great divide between the very small number of top mandarins and the very great number of more junior staff.", "... the conventional wisdom is that this divide was the work of Sir Stafford Northcote and Sir Charles Trevelyan, but once you start poking around in the archives the story turns out to be rather more complicated.", "... What is surprising is that, as originally drafted, the report contained only the most meagre proposals for establishing entry to the civil service via a competitive literary exam - one for intellectuals and one for mechanicals.", "There was such a proposal but it did not extend to departments subordinate to the Treasury.", "... Gladstone warmly supported other aspects of the report but criticised its limited attack on patronage.", "...", "He wanted the principle of competition 'sanctioned in its full breadth', and applied to the Treasury 'with unsparing vigour' [and] when the amended report was published nearly a year later it proposed to apply the competitive principle to all departments.", "...", "Early in 1854, [Prime Minister] Russell wrote to Gladstone to say he hoped Gladstone was 'not thinking seriously of the plan of throwing open to competition the whole civil service of this country'.", "...", "The departmental heads, in their response to the report, also criticised the thinking underlying the proposals for change... the Northcote-Trevelyan report was dead in the water.", "...", "In the face of opposition from top civil servants, and a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the part of most ministers - particularly the Prime Minister - Gladstone was not inclined to push the matter too hard.", "The idea of a central competitive exam was dropped, along with most of the other proposals.", "Only one other proposal was put into effect; in 1854... the Cabinet agreed to the creation of a central examining board.", "A year later the Civil Service Commission was established ...\u2014 Coolican, op.", "cit., pp 4, 95, 96, 105, 110, 112\nThe same model, the Imperial Civil Service , was implemented in British India from 1858, after the demise of the East India Company 's rule in India through the Indian Rebellion of 1857 which came close to toppling British rule in the country.", "[15]\nThe Northcote\u2013Trevelyan model remained essentially stable for a hundred years.", "This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change.", "It also had a great international influence and was adapted by members of the Commonwealth .", "The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act established a modern civil service in the United States, and by the turn of the 20th century almost all Western governments had implemented similar reforms."]}

{"question": "Gene Splicing", "summary": "[ 1 Gene splicing is a post-transcriptional modification in which a single gene can code for multiple proteins. ] This is accomplished by removing the noncoding regions called introns, from the initial or precursor RNA transcript, a process called splicing, and joining the remaining coding regions called exons into a contiguous mRNA molecule. This allows the exons to be translated into different protein isoforms with distinct functions. Gene splicing is an important mechanism for generating genetic diversity and regulating gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. There are different types of gene splicing, including alternative splicing, which allows the production of different protein isoforms from a single gene, and constitutive splicing, which is the splicing pattern of most exons in a gene. There are also different splicing mechanisms, such as spliceosome-mediated splicing, which is the major pathway in eukaryotes, and group II intron self-splicing, which is found in some bacteria and eukaryotic organelles.", "chunk": "Gene splicing is a post-transcriptional modification in which a single gene can code for multiple proteins.", "passages": ["References >> Gene Splicing\nGene Splicing Overview & Techniques\nGene splicing is a post-transcriptional modification in which a single gene can code for multiple proteins.", "Gene Splicing is done in eukaryotes, prior to mRNA translation, by the differential inclusion or exclusion of regions of pre-mRNA.", "Gene splicing is an important source of protein diversity.", "During a typical gene splicing event, the pre-mRNA transcribed from one gene can lead to different mature mRNA molecules that generate multiple functional proteins.", "Thus, gene splicing enables a single gene to increase its coding capacity, allowing the synthesis of protein isoforms that are structurally and functionally distinct.", "Gene splicing is observed in high proportion of genes.", "In human cells, about 40-60% of the genes are known to exhibit alternative splicing.", "Gene Splicing\nThere are several types of common gene splicing events.", "These are the events that can simultaneously occur in the genes after the mRNA is formed from the transcription step of the central dogma of molecular biology.", "Exon Skipping: This is the most common known gene splicing mechanism in which exon(s) are included or excluded from the final gene transcript leading to extended or shortened mRNA variants.", "The exons are the coding regions of a gene and are responsible for producing proteins that are utilized in various cell types for a number of functions.", "Intron Retention: An event in which an intron is retained in the final transcript.", "In humans 2-5 % of the genes have been reported to retain introns.", "The gene splicing mechanism retains the non-coding (junk) portions of the gene and leads to a demornity in the protein structure and functionality.", "Alternative 3' Splice Site and 5' Splice Site: Alternative gene splicing includes joining of different 5' and 3' splice site.", "In this kind of gene splicing, two or more alternative 5' splice site compete for joining to two or more alternate 3' splice site.", "Gene splicing leads to the synthesis of alternate proteins that play an important role in the human physiology and disease.", "Currently, the most efficient methods for large scale detection of splice variants include computational prediction methods and microarray analysis.", "Microarray based splice variant detection is the most popular method currently in use.", "The highly parallel and sensitive nature of microarrays make them ideal for monitoring gene expression on a tissue-specific, genome-wide level.", "Microarray based methods for detecting splice variants provide a robust, scalable platform for high-throughput discovery of alternative gene splicing.", "A number of novel gene transcripts were detected using microarray based methods that were not detected by ESTs using computational methods.", "Another commonly used method for discovering of novel gene isoforms is RT-PCR followed by sequencing.", "This is a powerful approach and can be effectively used for analyzing a small number of genes.", "However, it only provides only a limited view of the gene structure, is labor-intensive, and does not easily scale to thousands of genes or hundreds of tissues.", "Microarray based gene splicing detection poses some unique challenges in designing probes for isoforms that show a high degree of homology.", "In order to differentiate between these isoforms, a microarray that uses a combination of probes for exons and exon-exon junctions is used.", "Exon skipping events or other deletions can be monitored by using junction probes.", "For example, a probe spanning the exon 1 and exon 3 of the gene will detect the skipping of exon 2 from the gene that is translated into a protein.", "AlleleID\u00ae automatically designs junction probes as well as intra-exon probes.", "With AlleleID\u00ae you can design any combination of probes to detect any type of alternative splicing event."]}

Invoke Feeling\nAnother theory as to why people watch movies and visuals with such extreme violence is not for the violence per say but for the feelings it provides to viewers.", "Bartsch and Mares found that people do not actually enjoy seeing bloodshed or watching someone be beaten but rather they enjoy the feelings that come with it such as suspense and thrill (Barstch and Mares 956).", "They value how the scenes make them feel rather than what they are actually seeing.", "Various examples of this can be seen in Red Sparrow.", "The film displays a wide variety of violent scenes.", "Multiple violent rape scenes, torture scenes, murders, beatings, and mutilated corpses are among the many scenes shown in the film.", "Most people do not enjoy watching a scene of a woman being raped or watching a man being strangled to death, but they watch it anyway because of how it makes them feel.", "Bartsh and Mares theorize \u201cthat individuals may choose to watch violent, gory material if they anticipate that the depiction is a meaningful and valuable reflection of reality.", "While viewers might not enjoy watching a film about domestic abuse or the cruelties of war, they might nonetheless appreciate a serious and insightful reflection of these issues that acknowledges the human cost fully rather than eliding the violence\u201d (Bartsch and Mares 957).", "Therefore, they mean that if the violence looks real even though it may be shocking and gory it makes them understand the magnitude of what this would be like in real life.", "For example, in Red Sparrow there is a scene (see above photo) where a set of various torture knives are laid out and a man is about to be tortured for information.", "Then a skin peeler used for skin graft procedures is taken out and they begin peeling layers of the man\u2019s skin.", "While some movies would show this scene from a distance so that the audience could just see the motion of skin being peeled but could not actually see the skin coming off the body Red Sparrow takes this to new and gory heights.", "Instead they show a close-up angle of the skin actually being peeled off of his body multiple times.", "This tactic instills a greater amount of shock and feelings into the viewer, which is its purpose while the angle of the camera in this scene drives this feeling home.", "However, the viewer does not enjoy seeing skin peeled off.", "They enjoy the feeling that they get from seeing it happen.", "In fact, in the theatre people kept looking away from this scene but were then peeking through their fingers, or they would close their eyes but then a few seconds later would start watching again.", "This is because even though the visual that they are seeing is so shocking and gory, they still cannot help but watch it because of the thrill and the adrenaline that they feel from watching it.", "Another reason that violent and sexual images are used in films is because of the curiosity that people feel toward these subjects.", "For example, people do not regularly see someone getting raped, or murdered, or beat up.", "While these are horrible events the human brain cannot help but be curious about how and why these events occur.", "As Barstch and Mares discuss, \u201cthere are intense emotions and arousal, such as voyeurism and curiosity about taboo actions\u201d (Bartsch and Mares 958).", "For some viewers seeing violent or sexual images is like eating the forbidden fruit.", "They want a taste of what it is like to be able to see content that they would not have seen otherwise.", "Furthermore, violence can also be used to invoke other feelings like a sense of gratification for example.", "Viewers feel gratification when they see violent behaviour directed towards a villainous character, or when a heroic character gets rewarded (Bartsch and Mares 958).", "This can also be looked at through the lens of Red Sparrow.", "After so much violence and murder is inflicted by the main characters uncle throughout the entire film viewers finally get to see him experience what he deserves when the tables turn on him and he is the one shot and killed at the hands of his niece and the main character, and the one person her inflicted the most pain and suffering on.", "It is in this scene that readers get their gratification from watching the villain die.", "If the violence was turned around the other way the gratification received from the scene by the audience would be less because they would not feel that the character was that deserving of it.", "Violence is not just used to make viewers feel gratification and satisfaction but can also be used for various other feelings depending on the story line.", "For example, the goals of some movies or films is to make you shocked or recoil or jump back.", "For others it is to make you feel suspense, nervous, or even sick.", "Whatever, the violent visuals being shown, the purpose of it to invoke feelings, is still the same.Violence to Invoke Beliefs or Values\nThe final reason that film makers use extreme violence in films ties into the need to invoke feelings.", "People have a set of beliefs and values in life that help guide them.", "One of those beliefs and values is life and the life of others.", "For the most part people want to ensure that others are okay.", "In a film when people see characters experiencing extreme violence it reminds them of what their morals and values are.", "It reminds them that if it were not for their morals and values then they would not feel the way they do about another individual being hurt.", "The reason this ties into violence invoking feelings is because without invoking feelings one cannot invoke morals.", "We can see this again in Red Sparrow because of the politics in the film.", "In the movie, the Americans are working against the Russian politics and mobsters.", "The Americans however, follow protocol and do not engage in violence unless necessary while the Russian mob is the one that commits the murders and the torture.", "It is in these scenes that we can look at our beliefs and values and know that the way the people are being treated in the movie is not right.", "Why do we know that this is not right?", "Because of the beliefs and morals that we carry with us.", "Bartsch and Mares theorize that this is because \u201cthe need for meaning-making is aroused by negative events that violate an individual\u2019s belief in the world as a just place where bad things do not happen to good people (including the self)\u201d (Bartsch and Mares 960).", "Viewers like to think of the world as a just place where people are not punished for no reason.", "Therefore, when scenes like the ones above are mentioned the violence triggers this sense of our knowing right from wrong and what is just and what is not.", "Violence is used in films and the media for many reasons.", "However, gory and heinous the images we see maybe they serve a purpose and that is why they are present in so many movies.", "The reasons for violence being used all go hand in hand with one another.", "Violence sells tickets and entices viewers, and the reason that viewers are enticed and entertained by these images is because of how the images make them feel.", "If the images did not make them feel a certain way then they would not decide to purchase tickets to the film and the films would not make money otherwise.", "Without these feelings then we would not be able to relate the violence to our beliefs and values.", "Violent images in the media serve a purpose because of what they invoke in their viewers.", "This is the job of the visuals that media present to us.", "The purpose is for the visual to make us feel or think about something, otherwise there would be no reason for us to see it.", "The film Red Sparrow was the perfect example of a film the invokes violence for the purposes of feeling because without all of its violence and gore the film would not have been the same and would be able to give impact that it did.", "Works Cited\nBarranco, Raymond E., et al.", "\u201cViolence at the Box Office: Considering Ratings, Ticket

Crystal Lake became a name almost as iconic as its resident slasher, as the summer campgrounds established a new, trendy setting for slasher flicks.", "Crystal Lake's heavy forest provides dense coverage for Jason to wait in ambush as he picks off his unsuspecting victims, while its cabins provide few hiding spaces for those unfortunate enough to get caught smoking, drinking, or engaging in other forms of youthful debauchery by the masked killer .", "There's also the lake itself, which is the place where Jason drowned due to his counselors' negligence; it was here that the vengeful horror legend was born.", "Related:\nCamp Crystal Lake's mythical status is why shooting locations for the Friday the 13th films are so vital.", "Horror movie settings are almost always an important part of establishing the mood.", "Few other slashers have become as associated with their surroundings as Jason.", "The actual locations have changed from film-to-film almost every single time,

full-on Friday the 13th museum.", "Locals express that the date of Friday the 13th has practically become a holiday for the community since the town holds a \"Jason fest\" to celebrate the film's

also shot next door to Blairstown in Hope, making Jason and his mother true Jersey folk.", "The sequel moved from New Jersey to Connecticut so the crew could shoot in the rural, heavily wooded county of Litchfield in the west of the state.", "The village of New Preston provided the backdrop for downtown scenes, including the casino where the counselors visited the bar.", "The cabins along Camp Kenmont's North Spectacle Pond, located just outside the town of Kent, was where Jason stalked his prey at Camp Crystal Lake.", "In addition, the city of Waterbury, located in the much more urbanized eastern part of Connecticut, was where audiences visited the house of the sole survivor of the first film, Alice Hardy.", "Related:\nUnfortunately, the sets for this entry have not been nearly as well-preserved as those for the first film.", "Alice's house in Waterbury has been demolished, although interior scenes were shot in what is now a drug-treatment center in Torrington.", "The casino in New Preston was a popular nightlife spot for years before completely burning down.", "Camp Kenmont is still active, but the property was sold to another owner and the residences on North Spectacle Pond, called Bromica Lodge, were likewise destroyed.", "Part III marks the first time that a Friday the 13th film was not shot on the East coast, as the crew needed a more controlled environment to regulate the movie's 3D effects.", "Instead, production took place in Veluzat Motion Picture Ranch in Santa Clarita, California with its own constructed barn, cabin, and lake.", "The ranch is still used as a production site, but the cabin that was used in the film burned down in 2012.", "In addition, the scene with the biker gang was shot at what is now the Green Valley Cafe in the Santa Clarita area.", "In the first and almost only time that two movies technically shared a shooting location, the opening to The Final Chapter was also at Veluzat Ranch.", "Nevertheless, the rest of the film took place in different locations.", "The expendable teens went skinny-dipping in the waters of Zaca Lake, while they hiked along the trails that surround the area.", "The Zaca Lake Lodge, in fact, marks the third time so far that a Friday the 13th shooting location burned down, this time more recently in 2016.", "The place is a popular filming site, with its ties to Hollywood productions going all the way back to the silent era.", "Most notably, the lake was also where the Universal monster classic, Creature from the Black Lagoon , was shot.", "In addition, the residence of Tommy Jarvis and his family is a privately owned house in Topanga, CA.", "Despite the title of the movie, production for the series continued to remain in California in various locations around the Los Angeles area.",

of Atlanta, shares slasher blood with Rob Zombie's Halloween II , which was also shot there.", "The camp scenes took place in Camp Daniel Morgan around Hard Labor Creek State Park's Lake Rutledge, a couple of miles east of Covington.", "Luckily, the camp still exists and holds occasional tours and screenings, perhaps because Jason Lives is so well-beloved by Friday the 13th fans.", "A point of contention exists over which cemetery Jason emerged from at the beginning of the film.", "Fansites often state that it was Covington Cemetary, but screencap comparisons and recovered call sheet documents reveal that it was actually Old Madison Cemetary in Madison, GA.", "It's comforting to know that what is considered arguably the most entertaining entry in the series has its shooting locations comparatively well-preserved.", "Production for The New Blood stayed in the south but moved over to neighboring Alabama, specifically within Baldwin County and around the city of Mobile.", "Byrnes Lake was chosen for the outdoor activities this time, although this time the cabins were all constructed for the film and then torn down.", "In an odd bit of Southern flair, there was even a gator wrangler hired in case the beasts attacked the cast and crew, but the gators weren't active during the time of the shooting.", "A number of interiors were built in Los Angeles for filming, and the crew also went back to Topanga Canyon, California for the interiors of the house used in The Final Chapter .", "Jason's trip to New York City infamously doesn't even take place within The Big Apple for the majority of the movie.", "Despite the fact that Jason Takes Manhattan was the most expensive Friday the 13th film to date, $5 million budget still didn't cover the cost of shooting in New York.", "Instead, production took place mostly in Vancouver and surrounding areas within British Columbia, as well as with some interior shots in Los Angeles.", "The only scene that was legitimately shot in New York was in Times Square, which attracted a sizable crowd of Friday the 13th fans to watch Jason actor Kane Hodder don the hockey mask.", "Related:\nThe crew returned to

to be found here beyond a virtual simulation that's created for part of the movie.", "However, Jason X includes a fun cameo appearance where director David Cronenberg gets stabbed and showcases one of the franchise's most creative kills, with Jason offing someone in a vat of liquid nitrogen.", "Finally, after years of teasing audiences and inter-studio meddling, the big crossover between two icons of the slasher sub-genre, Freddy vs. Jason , was shot in and around Vancouver, using an impressive amount of on-location settings compared to the past few previous films.", "Jason's shack was located along the shore of the picturesque Buntzen Lake, although the set was demolished after filming.", "However, there were also some interiors and street shots that were filmed on a Universal Studios lot in Hollywood.", "The 2009 remake of Friday the 13th took the action to Central Texas around the Austin area.", "Neighboring Bastrop provided outdoor recreation areas for camp scenes in Friday the 13th

income inequality, but I think the economic anxiety leads people to UBI.", "MacKay: There\u2019s been a variety of studies.", "There were a couple of really famous experiments in the \u201970s in Canada and here in the United States.", "There was a really interesting study in Manitoba in the late \u201970s, where they had a whole town that was subject to a guaranteed income policy \u2014 a floor that families would not fall below.", "A lot of randomized controlled trials in low-income countries have been using cash transfers since the late \u201980s, early \u201990s.", "Some of these are conditional cash transfers.", "In Mexico, for example, you might get a cash transfer from the government if you send your kids to school and take them for yearly doctor visits.", "And there was one recently in Finland, where they gave $500 per month to unemployed folks.", "These are high-quality studies.", "The evidence has shown that the UBI programs are pretty effective in a number of different ways.", "The caveat I would give is that they happen in different contexts, and the interventions are very different.", "Wendt: An experiment in Kenya is the largest.", "It involves around 20,000 people and unconditional cash payments that cover basic needs.", "It started in 2017 and will last 12 years.", "There are four different groups.", "One group gets the cash for the whole 12 years.", "Another group gets paid up front rather than on a monthly basis, I believe.", "Another group receives payments for a shorter period of time.", "And then there\u2019s a control group that doesn\u2019t get any cash.", "Some people reported that it has changed how women see their role in the household, because they felt entitled to have a say over how to spend the money.", "MacKay: A big one is a reciprocity worry \u2014 that in order to get access to public benefits, you should be at least willing to participate in the labor market.", "Think of the earned-income tax credit.", "That\u2019s a cash transfer that goes to low-income Americans.", "But to get access to it, you need to be participating in the labor force.", "A lot of programs like SNAP [the federal government\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as the Food Stamp Program] and TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, another federal program] have work requirements attached to them.", "The Trump administration was trying to attach a work requirement to Medicaid programs, as well.", "The thought is, you should only get access to public benefits if you are participating in the formal labor market and earning an income.", "The question they ask is: Why should some group of individuals be participating in the labor force and paying taxes to fund a UBI for other people who aren\u2019t participating in the labor market?", "One of the responses to this is that UBI recognizes all those forms of contribution to society that aren\u2019t remunerated.", "Think about parents taking care of their children or poor people taking care of elderly family members.", "There\u2019s lots of ways in which people contribute to society.", "And you can think of a UBI as reciprocating in that sense, remunerating people for those contributions.", "Wendt: Another common worry is that UBI is a waste of money on the wealthy.", "Why should all of those wealthy people get a monthly check?", "If the goal is to do something about poverty, then why UBI, since the rich by definition are not poor?", "That\u2019s an understandable concern for sure.", "But the reply there is that depending on how the UBI is financed, the rich will not be net beneficiaries.", "They will contribute more to finance the UBI than what they get as their monthly check.", "MacKay: This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of a guaranteed income program that\u2019s aimed at people coming out of prison.", "I think it makes perfect sense.", "Part of the justification here is that people with a felony record face a lot of difficulty in terms of accessing other public programs.", "I think they\u2019re actually banned for at least some period of time from federal housing programs and from receiving SNAP benefits.", "Felons face a lot of difficulty getting jobs.", "Employers can legitimately ask if they have a record and deny them employment on that basis.", "So it makes a lot of sense that you would target this type of pilot project at those folks.", "If you think about who needs a platform in American society, it\u2019s going to be people who don\u2019t have access to these other programs and are economically vulnerable in terms of not being able to get a job.", "And so I think it makes a lot of sense that you would target the program this way.", "Oftentimes we discuss UBI as a major transformation to society, as a sort of utopian policy.", "That draws a lot of attention.", "But I think the discussion might lead to a simpler idea \u2014 just using cash payments in more of our social safety net programs.", "That might be more sustainable, more cost effective, than trying to try to implement a full UBI type policy.", "For that reason, what\u2019s happening in Durham \u2014 a guaranteed income for a very narrow group of individuals \u2014 is really interesting.", "One thing the pandemic has shown us is that the government got a little bit more comfortable with giving cash payments to people.", "Another thing I\u2019m really excited about are these proposals to expand the child tax credit, both coming from [Mitt] Romney and also coming from the Democrats, which you might think of as a basic income for kids.", "Every month, they would get a certain amount of money, maybe a few hundred dollars.", "The parents decide how to spend it, but the thought is it\u2019s kind of like a baseline for kids.", "We don\u2019t want to spend too much time focusing on the big UBI utopian policy proposals and miss that there\u2019s a lot of interesting and potentially really important, cost-effective policy proposals around using cash payments in very targeted ways.", "By Logan Ward, The Well"]}

chosen approach for decommissioning is a combination of natural orbital decay and the execution of a re-entry maneuver for final targeting and to control the debris footprint.", "This final maneuver is expected to require a large percentage of the space station\u2019s propellant reserves.", "Due to the high propellant cost of this final space station maneuver, the Earth\u2019s natural atmospheric drag will be used as much as possible to lower station\u2019s altitude while setting up deorbit.", "Eventually, once all crew have safely returned to Earth and after performing small maneuvers to line up the final target ground track and debris footprint over the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area (SPOUA -the area around Point Nemo), space station operators will perform a large re-entry burn, providing the final push to lower station as much as possible and ensure safe atmospheric entry into the target footprint.", "The space station will accomplish the deorbit maneuvers by using the propulsive capabilities of the space station and its visiting spacecraft.", "NASA and its partners have evaluated varying quantities of Russian Progress spacecraft to support deorbit operations.", "Additionally, NASA is evaluating whether U.S. commercial spacecraft can be modified to provide capability to deorbit the space station.", "Credits: NASA\nThe space station is by far the largest single structure ever built in space, and represents physics and engineering challenges when it comes to re-entry modeling.", "Station is primarily made up of a combination of truss elements, modules, solar arrays, and radiators.", "The truss acts as the backbone of the station, providing physical support for the solar arrays, radiators, and modules.", "The various modules provide pressurized volume for the many microgravity experiments, a habitable area for crew, and ports for visiting spacecraft to dock and undock.", "The solar arrays and radiators provide power generation and thermal control for station hardware.", "Credits: NASA\nBased on behavior observed during the re-entry of other large structures such as Mir and Skylab, NASA engineers expect breakup to occur as a sequence of three events: solar array and radiator separation first, followed by breakup and separation of intact modules and the truss segment, and finally individual module fragmentation and loss of structural integrity of the truss.", "Credits: NASA\nAs the debris continues to re-enter the atmosphere, the external skin of the modules is expected to melt away and expose internal hardware to rapid heating and melting.", "Most station hardware is expected to burn up or vaporize during the intense heating associated with atmospheric re-entry, whereas some denser or heat-resistant components like truss sections are expected to survive re-entry and splash down within the the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area (SPOUA -the area around Point Nemo).", "NASA engineers continue to refine estimates for the size of the re-entry maneuver necessary to control the size of these debris footprints and ensure debris falls within the desired target area.", "Point Nemo is the location in the ocean that is farthest from land.", "This remote oceanic location is located at coordinates 48\u00b052.6\u2032S 123\u00b023.6\u2032W, about 2,688 kilometers from the nearest land.", "Because of its distance from populated areas, this location is traditionally used for spacecraft disposal and represents an excellent target for ensuring any hardware that survives the heat of re-entry does not land near populated areas on Earth.", "NASA continues to investigate alternate footprint targets and ground paths for station disposal to minimize risk the to Earth\u2019s population.", "Credits: NOAA\nNASA will assess what internal components on the International Space Station can be used on commercial destinations or returned for display, including any science facilities, payloads, and other equipment.", "There currently are no proposals from commercial providers to repurpose major structural parts of the International Space Station, and such plans would have to consider the cost and difficulty of reusing such pieces of station.", "NASA has entered into a contract for commercial modules to be attached to a space station docking port with plans to later detach, and awarded space act agreements for design of three free-flying commercial space stations .", "In addition, much of the structural hardware on station was designed and built in the late 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s, whereas new commercial destinations will benefit from more recent technology advancements.", "Preserving the station in a museum presents significant logistical and financial challenges, please see the disassembly and return to Earth section above.", "The decommissioning plan for space station is the execution of a controlled targeted deorbit into a remote ocean area.", "During descent through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the space station would burn, break up, and vaporize into fragments of various sizes.", "Some fragments of station would likely survive the thermal stresses of re-entry and fall to Earth.", "Environmental impacts of these debris pieces within the anticipated impact area would be expected to be small.", "To best protect people and structures, the most remote areas of the ocean are targeted.", "Once the debris enters the ocean, it would be expected to settle to the ocean floor.", "Based on the findings of the International Space Station Environmental Impact Statement , no substantial long-term impacts would be expected.", "Last Updated: Feb 18, 2022\nEditor: Michael Bock"]}

waste generated in households and industries has to be disposed of somewhere .", "Due to this, it is dumped in large stretches of land in two ways.", "It is either piled above the ground or buried under the soil.", "Either way, the waste that ends up in landfills irreversibly damages Mother Nature.", "Firstly, the waste dumped in landfills contains harmful compounds and toxins that seep into the ground, ruining soil fertility.", "Moreover, when the contaminants reach under the ground, they mix with groundwater, resulting in poor drinking water quality in close-by areas.", "On top of that, the toxins released from landfills mix with rainwater, producing a highly toxic liquid compound, leachate.", "Leachate gets absorbed into the loam, rendering the land infertile and contaminating the groundwater tables.", "Simply put, the toxic elements from landfills, such as mercury, arsenic, lead, etc., compromise the quality of natural resources.", "As a result, life around dumpsites is impacted.", "But that\u2019s not all.", "Another side effect of the increasing volumes of landfills globally is the production of greenhouse gases.", "Typically, when a landfill is at capacity, it is covered with soil.", "In simple terms, trash is buried under the ground.", "This confinement of some particular waste materials, primarily organic items from settlements, spurs anaerobic (without oxygen) breakdown of particles.", "When said process occurs, methane gas is released, which is much more harmful to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide .", "Moreover, it is highly flammable.", "This means if a landfill site is exposed to even the tiniest spark, it will catch fire and damage the air quality.", "The harmful side effects of landfills mentioned above are enough to conclude that these trash-dumping sites are incredibly bad for the environment.", "But the good news is that we can reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills by recycling.", "With recycling, the volume of garbage will automatically come down, eliminating the need to dump it anywhere.", "But for that to happen, waste must be recycled on a large scale.", "And that\u2019s only possible if recycling becomes mandatory from a grassroots level, which will eventually result in mass recycling.", "However, unfortunately, there is still a long way to go before recycling becomes a norm across the board.", "Sourcing raw materials is a difficult task that comes with a significantly high price.", "On top of that, if the raw materials are non-renewable, the earth\u2019s natural resources are depleted.", "For instance, plastic production requires petroleum and oil, which cannot be reused once exhausted.", "Similarly, paper making necessitates deforestation, clearing thick forests for timber.", "These are just two examples; there are many more products that use non-renewable resources.", "The resulting rapid depletion of natural resources is undoubtedly alarming and must be stopped.", "That is where mandating recycling can make a difference.", "Recycling allows humans to conserve nature by using already existing materials for manufacturing new products.", "So, it\u2019s safe to say that recycling is an effective solution to save draining natural resources.", "Energy consumption is an integral part of any and all manufacturing processes.", "Industries use a ton of energy to make products because making items from scratch requires refining and preparing raw materials.", "Raw materials have to go through many extensive procedures in order to acquire a state suitable for manufacturing products.", "So, naturally, an incredibly high amount of joules are exhausted in the process.", "Add the energy required to actually make the intended item; the total volume will be mind-bogglingly high.", "But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way.", "If recycling is made mandatory and old raw materials are reused, they will not have to go through refining plants to be ready for further processing.", "That will automatically save a considerable amount of energy.", "That\u2019s not all.", "Acquiring resources for production purposes is also a rather energy-intensive procedure.", "So, every time an industry obtains fresh raw materials, it exhausts excessive energy units.", "On the contrary, if recycled items are utilized, industries will not have to source fresh raw materials.", "Concisely put, recycling conserves energy by providing old, previously-refined raw materials, reducing the requirement of joule volumes needed for treating fresh resources.", "Water pollution due to trash from landfills is a big problem.", "The waste from dumpsites washes away by rainwater and enters the ocean, contaminating the water.", "The contaminated water is then consumed by the fish, which then die because they ingest pollutants present in the ocean.", "Studies reveal that 79% of plastics produced end up in landfills, from where they are carried into the nearby water bodies.", "Each year 18 million pounds of plastic make its way to the ocean.", "Eventually, this plastic is consumed by marine animals, killing them.", "A report released by UNESCO revealed that 1 million seabirds lose their life to plastic every year.", "As the poor species plunge deep into the water to find food, they swallow pollutants and die.", "Besides the consumption of plastic, entanglement in plastic products is another cause of the death of marine life.", "According to WWF, 1000 turtles get entangled in plastic and suffocate to death yearly.", "Long story short, the ocean is becoming more and more polluted with every passing day due to the trash dumped on land that goes into the water eventually.", "A viable solution to this problem is recycling.", "Naturally, when products are recycled, they don\u2019t need to be dumped, which means they don\u2019t wind up in water bodies.", "As a result, marine mammals and animals get to live longer.", "As mentioned earlier, recycling enables industries to utilize old resources to make new products, which saves energy.", "But it\u2019s not the only thing that is saved.", "With fewer processes to run to treat raw materials, again and again, factories and plants can cut back their costs significantly.", "On top of that, when the demand for raw materials goes down, their prices are also reassessed and reduced more often than not.", "This means when a business does need to purchase virgin resources, it will not have to spend thick wads of cash.", "What\u2019s more is that interestingly enough, recycling is relatively cheaper to do than disposing of garbage , at least in America.", "All-in-all recycling is incredibly cost-effective.", "If it becomes compulsory, industries and businesses will be able to reduce their variable costs.", "Since recycling is a business, it requires plants and factories set up to recycle products.", "This means if recycling becomes more common, new facilities will be needed to meet the increasing demands.", "When that happens, naturally, personnel will be needed to run the new setups, creating job openings for people all over the world.", "According to a study , More Jobs, Less Pollution , if the national recycling rate becomes 75%, approximately 2.3 million employment opportunities will open up by 2030.", "Furthermore, it is worth noticing that recycling creates a minimum of 9 times and a maximum of 30 times more jobs than garbage dumping, landfilling, and incineration.", "Research conducted by the US Recycling Economic Information (REI) reported that the solid waste management industry employs 0.25 million people in the US.", "On the contrary, the recycling sector employs 1.25 million workers.", "All the statistics mentioned above are sufficient to conclude that recycling offers a significant number of job opportunities.", "Therefore, making recycling compulsory is an intelligent choice.", "It\u2019s a known fact that carbon in the atmosphere leads to various problems, such as acid rain, faster melting of polar caps, etc.", "Typically the waste that is not recycled is either incinerated or left to decompose.", "Either way, carbon is released into the environment.", "An increased volume of carbon in the atmosphere results in the following\n- Acid rain.", "Carbon dioxide disrupts the pH of rainwater, making it acidic.", "When this acidic water travels and mixes in the ocean, the ocean water also turns acidic, becoming a hazard for marine animals.", "- Respiratory problems.", "When people inhale air with high concentrations of carbon, they are more likely to develop respiratory conditions, in some cases even cancer.", "- Rapid melting of glaciers and polar ice caps, which causes flooding in low-lying areas\n- Global warming.", "CO2, with other greenhouse gases, absorbs heat from the sun and releases it consistently into Mother Nature.", "This heat radiation increases the planet\u2019s temperature over a period of time.", "In other words, it causes global warming.", "Recycling is undoubtedly one of the most beneficial practices we can adopt for a sustainable environment.", "Mandating it will be a smart approach to controlling the issues arising from disposing of garbage.", "Other articles you may also like:", "Some states and communities adopt mandatory recycling and composting laws and ordinances.", "Requiring all commercial and/or

cities distribute taxi cab medallions.", "Alternatively, \"universal roll-out\" can be provided, meaning that recycling, composting and waste bins and services are provided to all customers, rather
