indicator calculates the price of a basket of goods that an average household is likely to purchase.", "Traders typically follow the Core CPI, which is the normal CPI calculation excluding energy and food prices.", "Energy and food prices tend to be volatile and can be greatly influenced by temporary supply and demand imbalances, as well as external random factors such as weather, which can distort the CPI number.", "It is important to note that although the CPI report does have an effect on the euro, its effect is diminished because the eurozone\u2019s CPI Flash Estimate, the French CPI Flash Estimate, and the German Preliminary CPI are released at the end of every month, about two weeks earlier than when the official CPIs are released.", "So, you may want to keep an eye on various inflation indicators and patterns across multiple regions, especially CPI reports from Germany and France.", "Report to Focus On: ZEW Survey\nAnother way to gauge economic conditions in the eurozone

than yourselves.", "So in the case of Social Security, the Social Security Administration projects the trust fund will be depleted in 2034, but by 2034 the median boomer will be dead.", "And the same sort of dynamic applies to the national debt, which will reach crisis levels in next 20 years.", "And the same logic applies to \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 applies to climate, which is a problem

their upbringing, including exposure to relatively high levels of environmental lead.", "It was the only generation where bottle feeding was a majoritarian practice.", "But I think one of the other

entitlements.\"", "On his hope for Generation X and millennials\n\"I do have hope.", "Young people do seem to embrace an empathetic agenda, up to and including supporting senior entitlements, I think

an emotionally bland manner, that she agreed with what the journalist stated as British values.", "However, in the heated debates that followed, a number of public figures in the UK were not convinced that she truly felt remorse about joining Daesh (Islamic State), but rather that she only wanted to return to the UK because the caliphate had been defeated.", "Broader UK public opinion, according to some polls , suggested that she should be stripped of her citizenship and not allowed back into the UK.", "Tabloid newspapers even went so far as to suggest that the only thing that divided Britons are unanimous about is that Shamima Begum is a security threat, and that being stripped of citizenship is a just punishment.", "Shamima Begum\u2019s case prompts larger questions: does stripping someone of citizenship, or more broadly denying someone access to citizenship, lead to justice and security?", "What do we actually know about how citizenship-stripping and denying access to citizenship affect both the people as well as the countries in question?", "The UK is far from being the only country in favour of denaturalising citizens perceived as a security threat: countries such as the US , Netherlands , Germany , and Australia have all been introducing or advocating for legislation that would make it easier to strip citizenship from naturalised citizens who have dual nationality and can be seen as a security threat.", "But Shamima Begum\u2019s case was unique because from a Daesh poster girl , she was transformed into the citizenship-stripping poster girl.", "The UK Home Secretary decided to strip her UK citizenship, justifying his move with the interpretation of the British Nationality Act , which allows revoking of citizenship if it is \u201cconducive to the public good\u201d and if there is a justifiable belief that naturalisation would not leave the person stateless.", "As Devyani Prabhat, Reader in Law from University of Bristol points out, here it was presumed that she could access Bangladeshi citizenship.", "There was no discussion about the prospect that Bangladesh could, with the same logic, also denationalise her, given that she is a dual citizen.", "Indeed, Bangladeshi authorities did deny that she was their citizen.", "Shamima Begum\u2019s case therefore took citizenship-stripping to a new level: she was born as a UK citizen and citizenship-stripping left her stateless.", "This was not simply a denaturalisation of a naturalised citizen, but certainly a denationalisation of a British born citizen.", "Shamima Begum\u2019s motives for fleeing the UK and joining Daesh remain a matter of speculation.", "Yet the following is clear: as much as she failed her state, her state also failed her.", "The Home Secretary claimed that her child will remain a UK citizen as they are bound to protect the children.", "However, as Aoife Daly , Deputy Director of the European Children\u2019s Rights Unit (University of Liverpool), argues, there is very little attention paid to the fact that Shamima was legally a child herself and that she was groomed to become an \u2018IS bride\u2019.", "As many comments from experts across a broad political spectrum have agreed, this case shows that naturalised citizens and even citizens by birth of foreign descent were more likely to be stripped of citizenship and they could never be fully equal citizens to those who are seen as the \u2018traditional settlers\u2019.", "From the available data it seems that the \u2018white converts\u2019, who joined Daesh or other terrorist groups are getting a different treatment in their states.", "For example, there was no public discussion of whether Samantha Lewthwaite, white widow of the 7/7 bomber, should be stripped of citizenship, despite facing serious charges of terrorism and potentially having dual UK/Irish citizenship.", "Similarly, Dutch-born Begum\u2019s husband Yago Riedijk, was sentenced in absence to six years in prison and faces more charges upon returning to the Netherlands, but citizenship-stripping was off the table.", "And in New Zealand, Mark Taylor \u2013 dubbed the Bumbling Jihadi \u2013 was renounced by his family and the New Zealand government decided not to assist with his return from Syria.", "However, should he be able to enter the New Zealand Embassy in Turkey, he would receive assistance to return and also stand trial in New Zealand.", "Again, citizen-stripping was off the table.", "As Matthew Gibney, Professor at the Oxford Refugee Studies Centre, states: denaturalisation could be equalised with the notion of civic death , which means \u201cthe severing of the ties of responsibility between the state and its citizen\u201d.", "As the international order currently stands, it is states who protect the different rights of individuals.", "Therefore, becoming stateless in most cases means becoming rightless, or in the famous words of Hannah Arendt, without citizenship one does not have the \u201c right to have rights \u201d.", "Gibney also shows that denationalisation is not a recent invention, but has been present throughout history: perhaps the most notable case was the denationalisation of minority groups such as Jews and Roma under the Nazi-era 1935 Reich Nationality Law.", "It was only when these minority groups faced their civic death, that the concentration camps were introduced, as shown by Hannah Arendt.", "In more recent history, countries around the globe used more subtle ways to deny access to citizenship, mainly to groups of unwanted minorities.", "As the 2017 UNHCR Report shows, more than 75% of the world\u2019s stateless populations belong to minorities, a large number of them born on the territory where they are denied citizenship.", "For example, after the disintegration of Czechoslovakia in 1993, a number of residents on Czech territory had to naturalise to become citizens where they (in many cases) lived their whole lives as they were considered Slovak citizens.", "The conditions for naturalisation seemed very neutral: a five-year residence requirement and a clean criminal record.", "Nevertheless up to 25,000 Roma ended up having difficulties in accessing Czech citizenship.", "The reasons for this were that many Roma were not properly registered in Czech territory after being relocated by the Socialist government, and as they lost their jobs in the factory closures in the post-socialist transition, some committed petty crimes.", "An illustrative case is that of Romani man L\u2019udovit Gorej who, because of stealing four Euros worth of sugar beets, could not naturalise as a Czech citizen and faced deportation to Slovakia.", "As these measures disproportionally affected Roma, the Czech government found itself under the fierce criticism of human rights activists , and lifted these requirements for the naturalisation of former Czechoslovak citizens.", "Another case where minority citizens were turned into aliens with a legal decree happened in the Dominican Republic .", "The Dominican Republic used to be based on ius soli , which means all born on the country\u2019s territory were automatically Dominican citizens, except in the case of families of foreign diplomats, who were considered to be in transit.", "However, in 2013, the Dominican constitutional court re-interpreted the ius soli principle so all the descendants of those who did not have regularised residence from 1929 were now considered to be \u2018in transit\u2019 and not eligible for citizenship.", "With this decision, around 200,000 Dominican citizens of Haitian descent were retroactively stripped of their citizenship.", "One of the reasons for this decision was increasing racist sentiments towards black Haitians, who were blamed for growing criminal activity in the country and for being a drain on social welfare systems.", "Although they were left stateless, this decision was argued to be justified, on the grounds that they were seen as able to return to the Haitian side of the island, which was in reality was not the case.", "Another case of en masse citizenship-stripping in the recent period happened in Myanmar.", "Rohingya, largely a Muslim minority in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, have been dubbed as the \u201c world\u2019s most persecuted minority \u201d.", "More than one million Rohingya individuals faced difficulties in accessing their Burmese citizenship when they were not recognised as one of the national races in Myanmar.", "The shift in discourse that pronounced them as aliens coming from Bangladesh was accompanied by conflicts that left most Rohingya either internally displaced in Myanmar or refugees in the neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh.", "One might argue that these three cases of en masse minority statelessness are far away from the individual cases of citizenship-stripping that liberal democracies are grappling with at the moment.", "An argument might be made that while collective cases of denationalisation cannot be justified, in the case of individuals who joined groups identified as terrorist it can be justified, because these are unique cases that serve justice and the security of the states, and hence the public good.", "However, the question is: who draws the line among such cases?", "Even these individual cases have shown it is only some individuals who are stripped of citizenship as a form of punishment, while others are not.", "Citizenship-stripping severs the link between an individual and the state in an arbitrary manner, without a trial.", "On the other hand, citizenship-stripping does not produce arbitrary results: it is members of stigmatised minorities who predominantly end up as stateless, which signals that they were unequal citizens in the first place, according to Gibney.", "Creation of inequalities among citizens, in my strong view, is not just nor does it strengthen security of the country, but it can contribute to exactly the opposite.", "While writing this piece, Begum\u2019s baby died just after his mother was stripped of citizenship."]}

or may not be an issue.", "If a person is susceptible to forming stones, then foods high in animal proteins and salt may increase the risk; however, if a person isn't susceptible to forming stones, diet probably will not change that risk.", "- Medications : People taking diuretics (or \"water pills\") and those who consume excess calcium-containing antacids can increase the amount of calcium in their urine and potentially increase their risk of forming stones.", "Taking excess amounts of vitamins A and D are also associated with higher levels of calcium in the urine.", "Patients with HIV who

the hospital treatment.", "Over-the-counter (OTC) ibuprofen ( Advil ) is used as an anti-inflammatory medication, and narcotic pain pills may be provided.", "Antinausea medication may be prescribed either by mouth or by suppository.", "Tamsulosin ( Flomax , a drug used to help urination in men with an enlarged prostate gland) may be used to help the stone pass from the ureter into the bladder.", "- Because of their size or location, some stones may not be able to be passed without help.", "If the stone does not pass, then a urologist may need to consider using lithotripsy , or shock wave therapy (ESWL), to break the stone up into smaller fragments to allow those small pieces to pass more easily into the bladder.", "Shock waves are a type of ultrasound that fragments stones.", "- If the stone is located in a place where lithotripsy cannot be used, or if there is a need to relieve the obstruction emergently (an example would include the presence of an infection), the urologist may perform ureteroscopy, in which instruments are threaded into the ureter and can allow the physician to use a laser to fragment the stone.", "Occasionally, the urologist may be able to use instruments to grab the stone and remove it.", "- Since most patients have two kidneys, a temporary obstruction of one is not of great significance.", "For those patients with only one kidney, an obstructing stone can be a true emergency, and the need to relieve the obstruction becomes greater.", "A kidney that remains completely obstructed for a prolonged period of time may stop working.", "- Infection associated with an obstructing stone is another emergent situation.", "When urine is infected and cannot drain, the situation is like an abscess that can spread the infection throughout the body ( sepsis ).", "Fever is a major sign of this complication, but urinalysis may show an infection and cause the urologist to consider placing a stent , nephrostomy tube, or removing the stone to relieve the obstruction.", "Antibiotics use may be considered.", "Once a patient has passed a stone, there is a great likelihood that another stone will be passed in his or her lifetime.", "Since kidney stones may also be hereditary, this likelihood is passed on to the next generation.", "A patient who has experienced a stone is unlikely to forget the experience and often will arrive at the health-care facility already knowing the diagnosis.", "Those with recurrent stones may be given medication to keep at home should symptoms recur.", "- While kidney stones and renal colic cannot always be prevented, the risk of forming a stone can be minimized by avoiding dehydration .", "Keeping the urine dilute will not allow the chemical crystals to come out of solution and form the beginning nidus of a stone.", "Making certain that the urine remains clear and not concentrated (dark yellow) will help minimize stone formation.", "- Medication may be prescribed for certain types of stones,

"Because the Earth is roughly spherical, sunlight strikes the equator at a nearly perpendicular angle, which concentrates it in a smaller area and makes it more likely to be absorbed.", "However, the sunlight that strikes the poles does so at an increased angle, which spreads the sunlight over a greater area and makes it more likely to ricochet off (especially in areas already covered in snow).",

atmospheric particles before it reaches the surface.", "As a result, the closer a country is to the poles, the less solar energy it absorbs and the cooler it is overall.", "A second, closely related

sound effeminate and are recognized by the way they speak.", "They asked people to listen to recordings of 25 men, 17 of them gay.", "In 62 per cent of the cases the listeners identified the sexual orientation of the speakers correctly.", "Perhaps fewer than half of gay men sound gay, says Rogers.", "The straightest-sounding voice in the study was in fact a gay man, and the sixth gayest-sounding voice was a straight man.", "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nParticularly within North American English , gay male speech has been the focus of numerous modern stereotypes, as well as sociolinguistic studies.", "Scientific research has uncovered phonetically significant features produced by many gay men and demonstrated that listeners accurately guess speakers' sexual orientation at rates greater than chance.", "[1] Historically, gay male speech characteristics have been highly stigmatized and their usage may be sometimes coded to a limited number of settings outside of the workplace or other public spaces.", "Research does not support the notion that gay speech entirely adopts feminine speech characteristics \u2013 rather, that it selectively adopts some of those features.", "[2] Gay speech characteristics appear to be learned (rather than innate) ways of speaking, like many aspects of language, though their origins and process of adoption by men remain unclear.", "[3] One particularly relevant feature is sometimes known as the gay lisp , though researchers confirm that it is not technically a lisp .", "There are similarities between gay male speech and the speech of other members within the LGBTQ+ community.", "Features of lesbian speech have also been confirmed in the 21st century, though they are far less socially noticed than features of gay male speech.", "Drag queen speech is a further topic of research and, while some drag queens may also identify as gay men, a description of their speech styles may not be so binary (gay versus straight).", "[4] Like with other marginalized communities, speech codes can be deeply tied to local, intimate communities and/or subcultures.", "Linguists have attempted to isolate exactly what makes gay men's English distinct from that of other demographics since the early 20th century, typically by contrasting it with straight male speech or comparing it to female speech.", "[5] In older work, speech pathologists often focused on high pitch among men, in its resemblance to women, as a defect.", "[6] Since the gay community consists of many smaller subcultures , gay male speech does not uniformly fall under a single homogeneous category.", "[7]\nWhat is sometimes colloquially described as a gay \"lisp\" [8] is one manner of speech associated with gay speakers of North American English, and perhaps other dialects or languages.", "[9] It involves a marked pronunciation of sibilant consonants (particularly / s / and / z / ).", "[10] [11] Speech scientist Benjamin Munson and his colleagues have argued that this is not a mis-articulated /s/ (and therefore, not technically a lisp ) as much as a hyper-articulated /s/ .", "[12] Specifically, gay men are documented as pronouncing /s/ with higher-frequency spectral peaks , an extremely negatively skewed spectrum, and a longer duration than heterosexual men.", "[13] [14] [15] However, not all gay American men speak with this hyper-articulated /s/ [16] (perhaps fewer than half), [17] and some men who identify as heterosexual also produce this feature.", "[16]\nA 2006 study of gay men in the Upper Midwestern American dialect region found that they tend to lower the TRAP vowel (except before a nasal consonant ) as well as the DRESS vowel.", "[18] This linguistic phenomenon is normally associated with the California vowel shift and also reported in a study of a gay speaker of California English itself, who strengthened these same features and also fronted the GOOSE and GOAT vowels when speaking with friends more than in other speaking situations.", "The study suggests that a California regional sound can be employed or intensified by gay American men for stylistic effect, including to evoke a \"fun\" or \"partier\" persona.", "[19]\nSome other speech features are also stereotyped as markers of gay or bisexual males: carefully enunciated pronunciation, wide pitch range (high and rapidly changing pitch), breathy voice , lengthened fricative sounds, [10] pronunciation of /t/ as /ts/ and /d/ as /dz/ ( affrication ), [20] [5] etc.", "Research shows that gay speech characteristics include many of the same characteristics other speakers use when attempting to speak with special carefulness or clarity, including over-articulating and expanding the vowel spaces in the mouth.", "[21]\nIn terms of perception, the \"gay sound\" in North American English is popularly presumed to involve the pronunciation of sibilants ( /s/ , /z/ , /\u0283/ ) with noticeable assibilation , sibilation, hissing, or stridency.", "[10] Frontal , dentalized and negatively skewed articulations of /s/ (the aforementioned \"gay lisp\") are indeed found to be the most powerful perceptual indicators to a

burden on others -- such as homeowners who have seen the value of their home rise due to the market.", "Pursuing a progressive consumption tax -- taxing based on consumption rather than income --

Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) is the government agency responsible for enforcing regulations concerning unfair trade practices, which is how false advertising is classified.", "Depending on the relief sought, an action for false advertising can be filed in either a civil or criminal court.", "This is because false advertising is considered both a tort and a crime in the eyes of the law.", "Though it was not until more recently that private citizens were able to sue businesses for false advertising.", "Before states began implementing consumer protection and deceptive advertising laws, consumers could only submit complaints to the FTC who would then need to notify or penalize the business itself.", "Now, however, persons who have been injured by false advertising can pursue private lawsuits in accordance with the statutes enacted in their state.", "For instance, suppose you purchased a protein bar that claimed to have certain nutritional benefits and no added sugars.", "If it is discovered that the protein bar in fact has none of the nutritional benefits the company claims it has and it also has added sugars, then you may be able to recover damages by taking legal action against the company.", "There are many different ways that a business can engage in false advertising practices.", "Some of the most common methods include:\n- Adding misleading information (e.g.,

product appears bigger than it is);\n- Advertising a certain price, but leaving out the fact there are extra fees;\n- Claiming a company is having a \u201cgoing out of business\u201d sale to raise prices; and\n- Applying bait and switch tactics (i.e., advertising one product, substituting with a similar more expensive product, and claiming the advertised product is sold out).", "As previously mentioned, the FTC is the main federal government agency responsible for overseeing and enforcing false advertising regulations.", "However, given the enormous undertaking that this task requires, the FTC relies on consumers and competitors alike to report unlawful and deceptive advertising.", "The FTC will then investigate the complaint and if it discovers that an ad does in fact violate the law, it can take several actions.", "First, the FTC will notify and attempt to get the business to correct its errors on its own.", "If the business ignores this request, the FTC can issue a cease-and-desist order and file a lawsuit on behalf of injured consumers.", "During the case, the FTC may ask the court to grant an injunction against the business to have them refrain from continuing to employ false advertising practices.", "The FTC can also issue fines and may have the business or their third-party advertiser release new ads that provide correct facts and information, and may even force the business to admit that earlier ads contained false statements.", "The law that authorizes the FTC to carry out such actions is known as the \u201cFederal Trade Commission Act

Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d).", "The FFDCA dictates the type of information that needs to be disclosed in both drug advertisements and on food labels.", "As discussed above, almost every state now has a statute that protects consumers against unfair business practices and false advertising.", "Most states that have enacted false advertising laws have modeled them after the FTCA.", "Such state laws permit consumers who have been harmed by deceptive ads to sue companies responsible for the advertisement in question.", "A few states even provide for criminal punishment if fraud is part of the equation.", "For example, if the way a business falsely advertises a product rises to the level of fraud and is so harmful that it causes serious financial loss or health problems, that business can

symbols, etc.).", "Companies can use the trademark registration system to check that a mark they want to use is not already registered.", "In preventing trademark infringement and false advertising

false advertising will depend on many factors, such as the type of law that applies (e.g., federal versus state) and the cause of action (e.g., unfair competition, false advertising, fraud, etc.).", "Cases that involve federal matters will first need to be filed with the appropriate government agency before it can get to court.", "In such instances, the government agency responsible for overseeing the matter will sue on behalf of wronged consumers.", "When a claim for false advertising is based on state law, however, the statutes in the jurisdiction hearing the case will control the process.", "Also, in class action false advertising lawsuits that affect many individuals or involve businesses from more than one state, the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\u201cUDTPA\u201d) may provide guidance as well.", "In general, a person seeking relief for false advertising should first report the complaint to their local consumer affairs agency.", "The state agency will provide instructions for how to file a complaint, and can help a person to determine if they have a private right of action and how much their case could be worth in damages.", "If the individual does have a case, they should speak to a local business attorney to obtain further legal advice.", "Depending on how many consumers were affected, the attorney may recommend filing a class action lawsuit instead of an individual case.", "Regardless of which path is chosen, both will require filing the claim in court, serving the complaint on the opposing party, going through the pre-trial stages, and eventually either settling with the other side or proceeding with a trial.", "The penalties for false advertising can range from civil to criminal.", "If a plaintiff successfully sues a company for false advertising, they may recover monetary damages awards and can request that the court issue an injunction against the company to prohibit false advertising practices.", "On the other hand, if the business is charged and convicted of committing false advertising in a criminal court, they may have to pay hefty criminal fines, serve some amount of jail time, and change their business practices.", "In some cases, a business may even be ordered to pay restitution to its victims.", "Find the Right Business Lawyer\nHire the right lawyer near your location\nFind My Lawyer Now!", "Aside from either reviewing both federal and state regulations or hiring a lawyer to explain them, there is currently no set framework to follow to ensure an advertisement does not violate the law.", "However, there are several basic rules to abide by when advertising that will help a business to avoid running into legal trouble.", "These include:\n- Refrain from making deceptive or misleading statements when advertising a product or service.", "In other words, do not make claims that are knowingly false.", "Like in the protein bar example above, do not say a product can do something it cannot.", "- Remember to get permission to use endorsement materials, such as quotes, photographs of celebrities, scientific studies, and so forth.", "Do not just place it on the product or in an ad without getting consent and verifying its accuracy.", "- The same holds true when attempting to knock out the competition.", "Review statements that put down other businesses for truth and try to avoid making comparisons if possible.", "If the business feels it is necessary to compare itself to its competitors, then make sure to at least treat them fairly and honestly.", "- If a business is advertising a sale or promotion, then that business must have a sufficient amount of the sale items in stock.", "If this is not possible, say something in the ad that notifies consumers about such limitations.", "State regulations will typically define how much product a business should have in stock when running a promotion or sale.", "- Using the word \u201cfree\u201d in a promotion can also lead to legal ramifications.", "All terms and conditions must be stated in the offer.", "For example, if a business advertisement says, \u201cbuy one, get one free,\u201d it must state things like whether that includes taxes on the second \u201cfree\u201d bottle, if it pertains to the same brand, and so on.", "- If a business advertises that they offer easy access to credit lines or money-back guarantees, they must have proof that supports those claims.", "- Finally, if nothing else, always strive to be truthful with consumers.", "This is an extremely important guideline to follow, especially when it comes to advertising the price of goods and/or services.", "Working with an experienced lawyer for false advertising issues can be a valuable asset for your claim.", "A lawyer who handles false advertising cases on a regular basis will already be familiar with the laws that apply, will know which claims are strong enough to make it to court, and will be able to predict the possible outcomes of your case based on the relevant facts.", "Thus, if you believe you have suffered a harm, a financial loss, or a health scare as a result of false advertising, then it may be in your best interest to consult a local business lawyer to learn more about your options for legal recourse.", "Your lawyer will be able to assess the facts of your claim, can determine whether you have a viable case, and can help you with the proper legal procedures to get you the relief you need.", "In addition to the benefits just mentioned, your lawyer can also explain how the laws in your jurisdiction may affect your claim, can discuss the potential remedies you might recover if your case is successful, and can provide representation in court.", "Alternatively, if you are a business who is being sued for false advertising or needs advice regarding how to avoid false advertising issues, then you should hire a business lawyer for further legal advice.", "Your lawyer will be able to answer any questions or concerns you may have about false advertising, and can make sure your business ads are compliant with both state and federal laws.", "In the event you are being sued, your lawyer can also help you prepare your defense, determine whether there are any defenses you can raise against a claim, and represent you in court.", "False advertising is an actionable civil claim under Section 43(a) of the
